        <ul>
            <li>Be skeptical: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always verify information before trusting it.</li>
            <li>Don't share personal information: Never share personal information like your social security number, bank account details, or credit card number unless you're sure the person or organization you're dealing with is legitimate.</li>
            <li>Use secure and trusted websites: When shopping or banking online, make sure the website is secure (the URL should start with "https://") and is a trusted, well-known site.</li>
            <li>Be careful with emails and messages: Don't click on links in emails or messages from people you don't know. These could lead to scam websites or download harmful software onto your computer.</li>
            <li>Keep your computer and mobile devices secure: Use antivirus software, keep your operating system up to date, and secure your internet connection.</li>
            <li>Report scams: If you come across a scam, report it to your local law enforcement agency and to the platform (like your email provider or social media site) where you encountered it.</li>
