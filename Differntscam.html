        <p>Internet scams come in many forms, each designed to trick you into giving away your money or personal information. Here are a few common types:</p>
        <p><strong>Phishing:</strong> This is when scammers send you an email or message that looks like it's from a legitimate company, like your bank or a social media site. The message will ask you to click a link and enter your personal information. But if you do, the scammers will get your information instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Online shopping scams:</strong> These scams trick you into buying products or services that don't exist. The scammer sets up a fake online store or auction listing, and when you pay, they take your money but never send you anything.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment scams:</strong> Scammers will promise you high returns on an investment, but the investment doesn't exist or is worth much less than they claim. Once you give them your money, they disappear.</p>
        <p><strong>Romance scams:</strong> In these scams, someone pretends to be interested in a relationship with you. They'll build up a relationship over time, then start asking for money for various reasons, like a medical emergency or travel costs to visit you. But once they get your money, they disappear.</p>
        <p>Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always be cautious when giving out your personal information or money online.</p>
